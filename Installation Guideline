The first step is to install docker on your machines.

We assume that your cluster consists of 4 nodes

IP Addresses of our machines are :
Node 1: 192.168.100.100
Node 2: 192.168.100.101
Node 3: 192.168.100.102
Node 4: 192.168.100.102

We select one of them as Manager Node for docker swarm.
For instance; Node 1 is manager node for our cluster.

On Node 1, run following command:

docker swarm init --advertise-addr=192.168.100.100

Now, we can add other nodes on our clusters. To do that, 

Run following command on Node 1

docker swarm join-token worker

The result of the command like that

docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-31erm2z4d7ffzj1w57ziiqtyx46ptwollw4xqbkqfsdfotqaomsd-5l4xcg4bfvsfsdfufh72qxi0u5snp 192.168.100.100:2377

Copy the result of previous command and paste and run it on Node 2, Node 3 and Node 4.
After running the command, you see message on each node like that

"This node joined a swarm as a worker."

Now, if you run following command on Node 1,

docker node ls

You see list of machines which exists on your cluster

ID              HOSTNAME  STATUS  AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS

6v4ddxl3uj... * spark     Ready   Active       Leader

qqhb6uzkb3...   spark1    Ready   Active

wjh0x6n5gd...   spark2    Ready   Active

3kq85vylsd...   spark3    Ready   Active

We can install Apache Spark on our cluster, to do this you must download docker-compose.yml file on your Manager Node. 
After downloading the file, run following command on directory which exists docker-compose.yml

sudo docker stack deploy --compose-file=docker-compose.yml spark

The command creates only 1 master and 1 worker nodes. To increase the number of worker node on your cluster, run following command

sudo docker service scale spark_worker=<number of workers>
